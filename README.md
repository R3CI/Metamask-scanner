# MetaMask Scanner - Totally Innocent Proof of Concept ðŸ˜‡

**DISCLAIMER OF EPIC PROPORTIONS:**

This project is a **proof of concept** and is meant for **educational purposes only**. It is designed to interact **exclusively with wallets you personally own**.

By using this project, you agree to the following:

1. You will **never, ever, under any circumstances**, use this on wallets that are not yours.
2. You accept that the author is **not responsible** if you ignore this warning and get yourself into trouble.
3. This project is **not for hacking, stealing, or causing chaos**. Serious bad vibes will result if you do.
4. Use it only to **learn, experiment, or make your own wallet life better**.

**In short:** If you touch anyone elseâ€™s MetaMask with this, itâ€™s on **you**, not me. I am just a humble coder sharing knowledge.

This software comes with **no warranties, no guarantees, and zero magical protection**. If your wallet blows up, disappears, or turns into a digital pumpkin, thatâ€™s on you.

Use responsibly. Use legally. Use only your own stuff
